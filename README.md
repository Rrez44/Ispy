# Ispy
This is a key-logger along with a gui that will screenshot the screen when matching words are found 

Include the csv file and the icon.png file to the same directory, install all required dependencies too 

Most of what you need to know is in the information center that you can access within the interface.

The program allows you to add words of interest and screenshot when these words are typed into your keyboard

This program should not be used for any malicious intent

You should not add sentences to the csv because it will likely cause unexpected behavior, add single words only

When you add a word dont add words like "the king" instead add "king"

The screenshots are not saved in a specific directory instead they are saved somewhere in your computer with the name "fullscreen" + a random number

If you want to save it to a certain directory then feel free to edit the code, this function is located in main.py
